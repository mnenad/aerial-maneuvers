However, it is often tough to go from vision to execution when first getting started with Concourse; the simplicity can feel like a pile of building blocks ready to be moudled into anything!\r\n\r\nThis repo hopes to collect some strategies, stories from the trenches, and helpful tips to assist new Concourse users on their flight to the perfect Concourse CI / CD strategy!\r\n\r\n\r\n##Topics\r\n\r\nThere a several key topics which this documentation hopes to cover in-depth, and hopefully the list will grow as more users share their stories and strategies:\r\n\r\n###Pipeline Strategies\r\n\r\n* Continuous Deployment to CF\r\n\r\n###Deploying Concourse\r\n\r\n* Deploying Concourse in an air-gapped environment\r\n",
